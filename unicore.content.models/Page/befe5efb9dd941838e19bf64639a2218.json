Malaria deaths are very hard on families and can destroy the potential of future generations. \r\n\r\n**It ruins education**\r\n\r\nEven if a child survives malaria, it may force them to miss important days of school. In Africa, malaria is responsible for around half of missed days of school that can be prevented.\r\n\r\n**It destroys the economy**\r\n\r\nMalaria takes people away from work, taking valuable income away from many families. The\u00a0economic\u00a0impact of\u00a0malaria\u00a0is estimated to cost Africa\u00a0$12 billion\u00a0every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n**It is completely preventable and treatable**\r\n\r\nAll this damage is unnecessary and can be avoided. By learning about prevention and treatment, you can help prepare us for the fight ahead. Learn about malaria prevention and malaria treatment.\r\n",
